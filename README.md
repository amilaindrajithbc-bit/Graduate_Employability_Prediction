# 🎓 Graduate Employability Prediction System

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Graduate Employability Prediction System** is an end-to-end Machine Learning application developed as part of an **MSc Computer Science** project. The objective of this project is to predict whether a graduate is likely to be placed based on academic performance, technical skills, communication skills, and practical experience.

The project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning lifecycle, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, model deployment, and web application development using **Streamlit**.

This project follows a modular software engineering approach, where each stage of the Machine Learning pipeline is implemented as an independent Python module, making the application scalable, reusable, and easy to maintain.
